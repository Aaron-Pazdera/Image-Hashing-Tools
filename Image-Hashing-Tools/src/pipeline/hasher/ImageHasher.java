/**
 * This class takes {@link IImage}s from an {@link ImageSource}, hashes them
 * with an {@link IHashAlgorithm}, then passes the resulting {@link ImageHash}es
 * to an output. That output can be absolutely whatever you want, and do
 * whatever you want, just write a HasherOutput lambda expression.
 * 
 * The input to the hasher can also largely be whatever you want, just write an
 * ImageSource. This is made more difficult by two guarantees that ImageSources
 * have to make. They must be thread-safe, and when they run out of images they
 * must always return null. However, once this is done, you'll have a fully
 * multithreaded solution for hashing them and reporting the results, as well as
 * benchmarking the success rate for hash retrieval after some modification to
 * the image such as a crop, flip, rotation or noise.
