# Image-Hashing-Tools
A general purpose framework for finding near-duplicate images, which provides an image library for fast pixel comparisons, along with extensible implementations and tools for image hashing and attacking image hashes, including simulating jpg/jpeg compression.

## Supported Colorspaces (Entire project is WIP, finished items will have a ✓)
### Greyscale
### RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
### RGBA (RGB with alpha/transparency channel)
### YCbCr (Luminance, Chrominance toward blue, Chrominance toward red)
### CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black)
### HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity. A cartesian transformation of RGB colorspace)

## Supported Hash Algorithms
### Average Hash (aHash) ✓
Inspiration: [Hacker Factor](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html)
Pros: Very fast
Cons: Not extremely accurate
Description:

### Difference Hash (dHash)
Inspiration: [Hacker Factor](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html)
Pros: Almost as fast as aHash, 
Cons: 
Description:

### Perceptual Hash (pHash)
Inspiration: [Hacker Factor](http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php%3F/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) [PHash.org](https://www.phash.org/)
Pros: 
Cons: Slow
Description:

### RGB Histogram Hash
Inspiration: ["Image Hashing Based on Color Histogram" by Bian Yang, Fan Gu and Xiamu Niu](http://manu35.magtech.com.cn/Jwk_ics/CN/abstract/abstract1269.shtml)
Pros: Invariant to flips and rotations
Cons: 
Description:

### Greyscale Histogram Hash
Inspiration: ["Image Hashing Based on Color Histogram" by Bian Yang, Fan Gu and Xiamu Niu]
Pros: 
Cons:
Description: I figured that if an RGB histogram could be used to match images, then a Greyscale Implementation would also be useful for Greyscale Images.


### Slice Hash (My own original algorithm)✓
Inspiration: Shower thoughts
Pros: Faster than pHash, resulting hash is extremely small
Cons: As a result of such a small hash, collisions are more common. Best used in together with other algorithms like pHash.
Description:

### Block Mean Value Hash (blockHash)

Inspiration: ["Block Mean Value Based Image Perceptual Hashing by Bian Yang, Fan Gu and Xiamu Niu"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4041692)
Pros:
Cons:
Description:


## Supported Attacks (Not all yet implemented)
JPEG Compression Simulation

Flip Vertical L/R

Random Noise

Gaussian Noise✓

Subimage Insertion

## Example Usage

Create and match two hashes:
```Java
IHashAlgorithm h = HashFactory.AVERAGE_HASH;
ImageHash hash1 = HashFactory.hash(img1, h);
ImageHash hash2 = HashFactory.hash(img2, h);
boolean matchesNormal = h.matches(img1, img2);
boolean matchesStrict = h.matches(img1, img2, MatchMode.STRICT);
```
